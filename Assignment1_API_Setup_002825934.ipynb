This is the process that green plants, algae, and some bacteria use to convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of glucose, or sugar. It's the main way that energy enters the chain of life on Earth. The process occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent or Calvin Cycle.\n",

When light strikes the pigments (like chlorophyll) within the plant cell, energy is absorbed and high-energy electrons are produced. Water molecules are split in the process, releasing oxygen into the atmosphere. The light energy also helps to convert ADP and NADP+ into energy-rich ATP and NADPH. \n",
